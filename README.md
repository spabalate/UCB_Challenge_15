Create the Earthquake Visualization

Visualized an earthquake dataset by completing the following steps:

1. The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and chose a dataset to visualize.

- Selected a dataset to be given a JSON representation of that data. Used the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.

2. Imported and visualized the data by doing the following:

- Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

- Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

- Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

- Created a legend that will provide context for your map data.
