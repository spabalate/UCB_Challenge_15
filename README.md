Create the Earthquake Visualization

Visualized an earthquake dataset by completing the following steps:

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and chose a dataset to visualize.

When you click a dataset (such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days"), you will be given a JSON representation of that data.
